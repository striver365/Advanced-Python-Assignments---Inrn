    "and descriptors handle both attribute fetch and assignment by design: __ get\n",

    "__ setattr __ must also be coded. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation is also different: __ get\n",
    "attr__ and __ getattribute __ are operator overloading methods, whereas properties and descriptors are objects manually assigned to class attributes.\n",

    "Unlike the\n",
    "others, properties and descriptors can also sometimes avoid extra calls on assignment to unmanaged names, and show up in dir results automatically, but are also narrower in scope—they can’t address generic dispatch goals. In Python evolution,\n",
